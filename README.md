# kinematics

Utilities for physics and trajectory simulators.  Classes extend on NumPy arrays and provide support for embedded AstroPy units, coordinate frame transformations, and non-Cartesian coordinate frames.  Structures are designed to be flexible, lightweight, and scalable. 


See utils-tutorial notebook for further details.
